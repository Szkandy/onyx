CSS coding standard since Onxshop 1.8

- IDs and class names can use only lowercase characters and dashes.
- multiple selectors are writen on separate lines
- all properties and values for each selector are one line
- IDs and class names should not be abbreviations or shortened words
- responsive rules are written strait after each component rules

Example:

div.content,
div.content-wrapper {margin: 0; padding: 0;}
@media all and (max-width: 800px) {   
    div.content,
    div.content-wrapper {margin: 10px;}
}
